JENNYRAVE: HOW THE DICE ROLL

A music tool that runs in your web browser. It helps people create music using special parts called Dice Machines. You can use it to get new ideas quickly.

The main idea is that the app uses randomness to make music. Every time you roll the dice, the app makes sure the music sounds good and matches the mood you picked. It is an advance midi generator.
